*Description*: The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project is a framework within which a number of research centres produce predictions of the future evolution of the climate. Many climate centres use an ensemble approach, in which they produce several simulations for each scenario, using the same model configuration. By comparing these multiple simulations (“the ensemble"), we can estimate the probability that the climate will evolve in a certain way.

In this Github, you will find a notebook that contains : 

The extraction of the data from the catalog
A temporal comparison of 2 ice concentration scenarios in Artic
A Kmeans clustering algorithm for sea ice concentration
A scenarios comparison (in clustering and prediction for the year 2100)
A model comparison (in clustering and prediction for the year 2100)
The evolution of the size of the differents clusters
A seasonal of the evolution of sea ice concentration
PCA to see the evolution of the arctic sea ice
